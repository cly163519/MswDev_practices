Administration system - Design document:
1. 4 classes needed, course, student, grade, main(modified version: remove grade, add "admin class")
2. Course: id, name, student list,  grades(or grade should be as a single class?)
3. Student: id, name, score, course list
4. Main: file reading, functions(wait for adding)
5. 



Questions:
1.Why I do not need a list in Student class?
  If there is an arrayList in student class, can I pass the parameters in the construction method?

2.Do I need a setter or getter in every class?

3.
